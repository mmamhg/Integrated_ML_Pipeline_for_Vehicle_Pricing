🚗 Overview
This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline focused on estimating vehicle prices. It combines data ingestion, cleaning, feature extraction, and model training into a cohesive workflow. The pipeline leverages common data-science tools to ensure transparency and reproducibility. It demonstrates how to go from raw data to actionable price estimates, with evaluation metrics that help you understand model performance and potential biases.

The pipeline is implemented with Python and leverages libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It also uses Jupyter notebooks for exploration and demonstration. The workflow is designed to be practical, not just theoretical. It targets learners who want to understand how all the pieces fit together in a real pricing scenario.

🧭 Goals and scope
- Provide a clear, repeatable process for vehicle price estimation.
- Show how to preprocess real-world data with missing values, inconsistent formats, and categorical features.
- Demonstrate simple to intermediate machine learning models suitable for regression tasks.
- Offer guidance on evaluating models in a meaningful way for pricing tasks.
- Provide scripts and notebooks that can be extended to other product categories beyond vehicles.
- Document decisions, trade-offs, and reasoning so future researchers can learn from the choices made here.

🚀 Quick start
Here is a straightforward path to begin exploring the project.

- Inspect sample data
  - Open data/sample_vehicle_data.csv to see the structure.
  - Note the feature columns and the target variable (price).
- Run a notebook to see a baseline
  - In notebooks/, run 01_baseline_model.ipynb to learn how a simple model performs on the data.
- Train a model end-to-end
  - Use scripts/train.py to train the pipeline on your dataset.
  - Example:
    - python scripts/train.py --config configs/default.yaml
- Validate results
  - The pipeline prints metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R^2.
  - Check the visualizations in notebooks/plots for a quick glance at residuals and feature importances.

If you prefer a guided experience, follow the notebooks in notebooks/ that walk you through data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretation step by step.

🧪 Data and preprocessing
Data quality drives model performance. This project emphasizes robust handling of real-world data challenges.

Data sources
- Public vehicle datasets that include features like make, model, year, mileage, engine size, transmission type, fuel type, and price as the target.
- Synthetic datasets generated to illustrate edge cases such as missing values, outliers, and inconsistent units.

Data quality checks
- Column presence: Ensure required columns exist (make, model, year, mileage, engine_size, transmission, fuel_type, price).
- Type validation: Verify numeric fields are numeric; categorical fields are strings.
- Missing values: Assess missingness in each column and apply appropriate imputation strategies.
- Outliers: Detect extreme values that could distort training and remove or cap them appropriately.
- Consistency: Standardize units (e.g., mileage in miles or kilometers) and consistent categorical labels (e.g., “Automatic” vs “Auto”).

Preprocessing pipeline
- Feature engineering
  - Age calculation: age = current_year - year
  - Mileage normalization: scaled mileage per year
  - Engine size normalization
  - Encoding: one-hot encoding for categorical features such as make, model, transmission, fuel_type
  - Interaction features: price-related features like age_mileage_ratio
- Handling missing values
  - Categorical: fill with a new category like "Unknown" or the mode
  - Numeric: impute with median or model-based imputation
- Scaling
  - Standardize numeric features when using linear models
- Pipeline composition
  - Use scikit-learn Pipeline to chain preprocessing with model training
  - Ensure reproducibility with a fixed random_state

Feature engineering ideas
- Aggregate features by brand: popularity, average price by brand
- Model family encoding: map models to a common family or sub-brand
- Seasonal or regional indicators if location data exists
- Derived features like price-per-year, price-per-mile, and log(price)

Modeling and algorithms
This project demonstrates a practical mix of regression models that balance performance with interpretability.

Baseline models
- Linear Regression with L2 regularization (Ridge)
- Lasso for feature selection
- ElasticNet to balance both

Tree-based models
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Extra Trees Regressor

Boosted tree ensembles (optional)
- XGBoost or LightGBM if you want to push performance further (note: these are optional dependencies)

Model selection criteria
- Predictive accuracy: RMSE, MAE
- Robustness: performance across different data slices
- Interpretability: feature importances from tree-based models
- Training efficiency: training time and resource usage

Evaluation and interpretation
Evaluation is more than a single score. It helps you understand where the model may fail and why.

Metrics
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- R^2 (Coefficient of determination)
- Median Absolute Error for robust performance

Cross-validation
- Use k-fold cross-validation to estimate generalization
- Maintain a fixed seed for reproducibility
- Evaluate across folds and report mean and standard deviation

Interpretation tools
- Feature importances from tree-based models
- Partial dependence plots to reveal relationships between features and price
- Residual analysis to identify systematic errors
- Calibration curves to assess how well predicted prices match observed values

Experiment tracking
- Record hyperparameters, feature sets, and model versions
- Save model artifacts along with a small report of the results
- Use a lightweight experiment ledger in configs/ to keep things organized
