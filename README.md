# Integrated ML Pipeline for Vehicle Pricing

## üìö Introduction

My name is **Stefano Caramagno**, and I'm pleased to present this repository containing a project on creation of a **integrated ML pipeline for vehicle pricing**.<br>
This project was completed as part of the **Machine Learning** course during my **Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering** at the **University of Catania**.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Data Loading**: Performs structured loading of the dataset, inspects variable types, and analyzes initial distributions to understand data composition and structure.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing features to ensure model compatibility.  
- **Supervised Learning Models**: Implements a broad range of regression algorithms to predict car prices, covering both linear and non-linear supervised techniques.  
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Applies hyperparameter tuning techniques to identify optimal configurations and improve the generalization of supervised models.
- **Supervised Model Evaluation**: Evaluates and compares regression models using performance metrics and validation techniques to measure prediction effectiveness.  
- **Unsupervised Learning Techniques**: Applies clustering algorithms to group data points based on hidden patterns, aiming to discover natural structures in the dataset.  
- **Unsupervised Model Evaluation**: Evaluates and compares clustering models results using general-purpose techniques and visualizations to assess quality of groupings.  
- **Semi-Supervised Learning Models**: Implements models that leverage both labeled and unlabeled data to replicate real-world scenarios with incomplete supervision.  
- **Semi-Supervised Model Evaluation**: Evaluates and compares semi-supervised models by analyzing learning effectiveness and performance across different label distributions.  
- **End-to-End ML Pipeline**: Organizes the entire machine learning process from data loading to prediction and evaluation, ensuring workflow reproducibility and clarity.  
- **Result Documentation**: Summarizes findings through structured markdown cells, explaining key insights and guiding interpretation of each analytical stage.
